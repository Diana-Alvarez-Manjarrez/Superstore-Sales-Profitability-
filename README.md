# Superstore Sales & Profitability 
## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to evaluate the sales and profitability performance of the retail superstore across different regions, states and product categories. While total revenue may appear strong at the surface level, looking at individual states and what can improve can help improve profitability and sustainability.

## Business Problem
Which regions, states, and product categories are driving profit and which are causing losses? Where should the company focus on growth?

## Why is it important?
Understanding profit performance is essential for:
•	Identifying underperforming markets<br>
•	Reducing financial losses<br>
•	Optimizing pricing and discount strategies<br>
•	Improving inventory and product mix decisions<br>
•	Supporting long-term business growth<br>
Without this a company can risk promoting loss generating products.

## Data Description
The Superstore dataset  contains historical retail transaction data:
•	Order date and ship date<br>
•	Sales revenue and profit<br>
•	Discounts <br>
•	Product category and subcategory<br>
•	Customer segments<br>
•	Geographical location (Region, State, City)<br>

## Data preparation and tools used
Tools used:<br>
•	Tableau (for dashboard visualizations)<br>
•	Excel (Data formatting and validation)<br>

## Data preparation:
•	Standardized date fields for trend analysis <br>
•	Created calculated fields for:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Profit margin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	YoY sales growth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Total sales and total profit<br>
•	Grouped states into profit vs loss categories<br>
•	Built dynamic filters for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Region<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Category<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Time period<br>

## Dashboards and Visuals created

This project contains dashboards showing:<br>
•	Sales and profit trends over time<br>
•	Profit and loss distribution by state<br>
•	Top and bottom performing products<br>
•	Category and sub category profitability<br>

## Key findings
•	While some states consistently generate strong profits, several others operate at a net loss, indicating inefficiencies in pricing or operating costs.<br>
•	Profitability varies significantly by region suggesting the need for customized regional strategies rather than single nationwide approach.<br>
•	10 states are operating at a loss.<br>
•	Certain product sub categories perform poorly suggesting the need for a better sales strategy or cutback on inventory for that product.<br>

## Limitations of the analysis
•	The dataset does not include actual operating costs, which limits full profitability modeling.<br>
•	Promotional timing and seasonality effects ae not fully captured.<br>
•	Customer behavior factors such as loyalty and lifetime value are not available.<br>
